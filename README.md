# Python_project_sql
This project is a focused effort to benchmark the performance of a MySQL database using Python scripts. The primary objective is to assess the efficiency and response times of the MySQL database by creating a custom benchmarking tool.
Database Connection: Develop Python scripts that establish a connection to the MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library. This connection is the foundation for executing SQL queries and measuring performance.
**Technologies Used:**
    Python 3
    MySQL
    mysql-connector-python for MySQL interaction
